# Laterite

Get paid. Lay a brick. A non-custodial autopilot on Solana that turns a capped slice of every payday into tokenized S&P 500, straight from your own wallet.

## Project Structure

apps/landing/        Marketing site (Next.js)
docs/                Architecture decision records

tests/fork/          Mainnet-fork tests (Surfpool)
```

## Prerequisites

1. Rust (rustup); the toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml` installs itself.
2. Solana CLI 4.1.2: `sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/v4.1.2/install)"`
3. Anchor 1.2.0: `cargo install --git https://github.com/otter-sec/anchor avm --locked --force && avm install 1.2.0 && avm use 1.2.0`
4. Node 24.14.0 (`.nvmrc`) and pnpm (the version in `package.json` is fetched automatically).
5. just: `brew install just`
6. Surfpool 1.6.0 (fork tests): `curl -sL https://run.surfpool.run/ | VERSION=v1.6.0 bash`, and a mainnet RPC URL in `.env` (see `.env.example`).
7. Devnet assets: Anchor 1.0.2 through `avm` and Agave installed with `agave-install` (the DEX source pins Agave 3.1.10; `just build-cpmm` switches to it for the build and back), plus Surfpool (above).

## Quick Start

```bash
just setup
just build
just test
just check
```

Run `just` to list every recipe.

## Fork Testing

`just test-fork` boots a Surfpool mainnet fork (datasource from `SURFPOOL_DATASOURCE_RPC_URL` in `.env`), installs the program at its declared address and runs `tests/fork`. It needs network access and is not part of `just test`. Swap routes are restricted to classic pools on the fork because market-maker pools depend on quote accounts that go stale once cloned.

## Devnet

Devnet has no USDC, USDT or xStocks that Laterite can mint, and no venue that trades them, so the repository creates its own:

- USDC and USDT stand-ins (SPL Token, 6 decimals).
- SPYx and QQQx stand-ins. Each copies its mainnet mint's Token-2022 configuration; only authorities differ.
- Four pools (SPYx/USDC, SPYx/USDT, QQQx/USDC, QQQx/USDT) on our own deployment of [Raydium CPMM](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-cp-swap) (Apache-2.0), built from a pinned commit with only its devnet ids and admin keys replaced. See `docs/002-devnet-dex.md`.

The public addresses live in `packages/devnet/addresses.json`.

```bash
just devnet-local          # local Surfpool forking devnet (port 18899)
just devnet-assets local   # create or verify everything; `devnet` targets devnet itself
just test-devnet local     # parity with mainnet mints, swaps, re-peg, idempotency
just devnet-repeg local    # swap every pool back to the live mainnet price
```

### Keys

All keys live in `keys/` (git-ignored). The shared keys also live in the team password manager.

| Key                                                        | Holds                                                                                               | Stored                                          |

| `devnet-faucet`                                            | USDC/USDT mint authority                                                                            | `keys/`, password manager, app host secret      |
| `devnet-treasury`                                          | Pool creator and LP owner, re-peg trader, token inventory                                           | `keys/`, password manager, service host secret  |

| `devnet-usdc`, `devnet-usdt`, `devnet-spyx`, `devnet-qqqx` | Mint addresses                                                                                      | `keys/`                                         |

The faucet and treasury keys never share a host, and the issuer key is never deployed.
